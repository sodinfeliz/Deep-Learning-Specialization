# Deep Learning Specialization

This repository includes the graded code assignments, but not the quizzes. <br>
It's 2022 versions of the course taught by Andrew Ng. See more details in [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).<br>
Ps. If you fail the tests on your own environment, check `requirements.txt` to match the dependencies.
